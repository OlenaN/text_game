## Sample

An entity is drifting through nothingness.

> enter name

There doesn't seem to be any purpose for a dimentionless entity to have a name.

> enter name

As untethered from reality and any frame of reference as this entity is, maybe even it requires an identifier.

> enter name

Type a name for this entity:

The entity has a name.

> continue

[falling code animation]

Your name is NAME and you suddenly have an identity. You have been nothing for forever, and now you are something. Around you, things are beginning to materialize.

> move closer

You fight, as if against a current, for a tether to the material plane. It appears you have a choice.

> stop fighting [back to start]
> keep fighting

You begin to notice a feeling. 

> move closer

In comparison to nothingness, this feels bizarre. It is the feeling of taking up space. Welcome to the 3rd dimention.

> enter the 4th dimention

You realize that you have already been experiencing the 4th dimention. Perhaps your path is not as simple as you thought.

> explore the dimention in which you exist

Parsing the world is fairly intuitive. You understand things by the distance they are from the seat of your conciousness. You have control over parts of the world.

> control what you can

What would you like to control?

*
> wiggle fingers
> wiggle toes
> breath deeply
> open your eyes
*

From behind your eyelids, you can see a faint neon glow. Concentrating, you manage to unsheath your eyeballs from their fleshy prison.
